		<p>I am currently enrolled at the University of Maine at Orono and am majoring in Business Management. The main reason I chose to go to UMaine was because I am originally from Maine and wanted to go to an in-state Division 1 school. The reason I am majoring in Business Management is because I am facinated about business and hope to one day own/manage my own business and make lots of money. </p>
