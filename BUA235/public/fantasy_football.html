		<p>One of my main hobbies is fantasy football. It's a simple yet fun game and makes watching football every Sunday that much more enjoyable. It's fun to root for specific players and can instantly make any NFL game exciting to watch if you own a player on your fantasy team that is playing in that game. I have been playing for multiple years now and every year it becomes more and more fun to engage in. </p>
