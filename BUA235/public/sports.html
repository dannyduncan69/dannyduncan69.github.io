		<p>I'm a huge sports fan and my favorite sports are football, basketball, and baseball. My favorite sports teams include the Denver Broncos, Boston RedSox, and Boston Celtics. I played both varsity soccer and basketball while in high school as well as little league baseball when I was younger. Although I am not the greatest, I am always down for a pickup game of basketball anytime, anyplace. </p>
